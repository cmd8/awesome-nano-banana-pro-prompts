**Nano Banana Pro prompt:**
> Traditional, whimsical watercolor illustration with a storybook aesthetic. Here is a breakdown of the key elements: Medium: Primarily watercolor painting, characterized by soft, translucent washes of color, blending effects (especially in the sky and water), and visible pigment texture. Linework: Features distinct, sketchy, hand-drawn black ink outlines that define the figures, landscape, and text. These lines are loose and irregular, contributing to an informal, charming feel. Color Palette: The colors are natural, subdued, and earthy, dominated by soft blues (sky/water), various greens (trees/grass), and browns (dirt path/clothing). The palette feels nostalgic and pleasant, avoiding harsh or overly saturated tones. Composition & Tone: The scene has a storybook or picture book quality—it's idealized, warm, and sentimental, centered on the adventure of a father and child. The title's script font enhances this narrative, inviting, whimsical tone. Overall Impression: The style evokes a feeling of nostalgia, adventure, and classic illustration, similar to the look of early 20th-century children's books or nature guides.

**Workflow:** Nano Banana Pro (requires uploading a PDF of a paper)

**Nano Banana Pro prompt:**
> Carefully read the following paper and generate a single, engaging, high-resolution infographic that accurately and comprehensively explains its key concepts, methods, results and conclusions. Extract as much meaningful information as possible and represent it visually in a clear, well-structured layout that aids comprehension, understanding, and long-term memorization. Do not use generic or cliche infographic elements (such as random icons, stock arrows or decorative charts), instead, design the layout, visual metaphors and graphic elements to closely match the content's tone, theme and depth. Ensure that all visual elements, symbols and color cues are strong, consistent and easily identifiable and that every part of the infographic faithfully reflects the content without adding information that is not supported by the text.

<details>
<summary>Prompt</summary>

<br>

**Nano Banana Pro prompt:**
> A highly detailed, chaotic, hand-drawn "Wimmelbilder" style cartoon illustration, viewed from a high-angle isometric perspective, summarizing the year 2024. The art style should mimic a vibrant comic book or "Mad Magazine" end-of-year wrap-up, featuring bold line art, flat bold colors, and slightly exaggerated caricatures. The composition is divided into three distinct layers:
>
> The Sky (In Memoriam):
> The top section features fluffy white clouds against a blue sky. Nestled within the clouds are kindly, monochrome or pastel-colored caricature portraits of famous figures who passed away in 2024. Include James Earl Jones (perhaps smiling warmly), Maggie Smith (wearing a witch's hat), Akira Toriyama (with a small dragon on his shoulder), and Donald Sutherland.
>
> The Skyline (Media & Tech Giants):
> The middle section is a dense wall of skyscrapers covered in massive billboards and neon signage representing the biggest entertainment and tech of the year.
>
> Movies/TV: A massive billboard for "Dune: Part Two" featuring a cartoon sandworm, a colorful sign for "Inside Out 2" featuring the orange "Anxiety" character, a poster for "Deadpool & Wolverine" with the two characters high-fiving, and a "Fallout" TV show sign featuring a Vault Boy giving a thumbs up.
>
> Tech: A giant, comedic robot labeled "AI" dominating the center, typing on a laptop while human writers look worried. A billboard advertising the "Apple Vision Pro" with a character walking blindly while wearing the headset.
>
> Centerpiece: A large, festive banner strung between buildings that reads "HERE'S TO 2024!"
>
> The Street Level (Viral Moments & News):
> The bottom section is a crowded, bustling street scene filled with vignettes of 2024's viral events and news stories interacting with each other:
>
> Sports: A section dedicated to the Paris Olympics, featuring a breakdancer doing a "kangaroo" hop (Raygun) and a pole vaulter looking awkward near a crossbar.
>
> Music & Culture: A large group of people dressed in lime green partying (representing "Brat summer"), alongside a caricature of Taylor Swift cheering at a football game. Two rappers (representing the Kendrick/Drake beef) standing on opposite street corners shouting comically at each other.
>
> Viral Animals: A small, chaotic baby hippo (Moo Deng) running loose and nipping at people's ankles.
>
> News/Events: A crowd of people all looking up at the sky wearing cardboard glasses (for the Solar Eclipse). A futuristic, angular silver truck (Cybertruck) looking broken down on the side of the road. A chaotic voting booth scene representing the "Year of Elections" globally, with cartoonish Donkey and Elephant mascots boxing in a ring.
>
> Atmosphere:
>
> The overall mood should be frantic, humorous, and overwhelming, capturing the "doom-scrolling" energy of the year while remaining colorful and fun.
